DEPRECATED

===

https://github.com/therealklanni/guppy-pre-commit version 0.4.0 already supports local Gulp installation (as opposed to Gulp that installed globally). If you use this fork because you need to support local Gulp installation, you can use https://github.com/therealklanni/guppy-pre-commit version 0.4.0 instead.
